[h1]Description[/h1]

[h1]How does it work? [/h1]
The mod monitors the twitch chat, similar to how the Twitch mode listens for # votes, and initiates events based on specific Twitch chat messages. The mod exclusively pays attention to a specified Twitch account, which you will configure as your Twitch bot.

Consequently, it is necessary to set up your Twitch bot to generate properly formatted chat messages when a specific event occurs, serving as a trigger for a redemption. Example instructions on how to set this up can be seen below.
