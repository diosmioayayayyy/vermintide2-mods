[h1]Description[/h1]
This mod adds twitch redeems to Vermintide 2.
Twitch viewers are able to spawn enemies and more (SoonTM).
Enemies spawned via redeems will have [b]purple glowing eyes[/b].

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
[list]
[*] Twitch channel
[*] Twitch bot (e.g.Streamer.bot)
[/list]

[b]All players must have the mod; otherwise, they will crash![/b]

[h1]How does it work? [/h1]
The mod monitors the twitch chat, similar to how the Twitch mode listens for # votes, and initiates events based on specific Twitch chat messages. The mod exclusively pays attention to a specified Twitch account, which you will configure as your Twitch bot.

Consequently, it is necessary to set up your Twitch bot to generate properly formatted chat messages when a specific event occurs, serving as a trigger for a redemption. Example instructions on how to set this up can be seen below.

You also have to connect to a Twitch account, just like with regular Twitch games.
Currently the redeems only work in conjunction with regular twitch votes.
